# Simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms

<div align="justify">
  CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that 
  whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU 
  scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution. [References: https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html#1]. My team member and I have picked Preemptive SJF, Non Preemprive SJF and Preemptive Priority for our TSN2101 Operating System's assignment and below are the Pre-assigned case 
  that we are expected to fulfill.

## Pre-Assigned Case

1. User should be able to enter the details about the processes such as Arrival Time, Burst Time and Priority that assigned at the beginning of simulation and the number of          processes can range from 3 to 10.
2. Executing the program should show the Gantt chart (visual form) of each algorithm.
3. Calculation of
    - Turnaround time for each process,
    - Total and Average Turnaround time for the entire processes,
    - Average waiting time for each process,
    - Total and average waiting time for the entire processes.
